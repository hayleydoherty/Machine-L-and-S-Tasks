The null hypothesis states that there is no difference between the expected and observed values and if this is true then the test statistic calculated from these values will be chi-squared distributed [4]. This is the distribution of a sum of the squares of *k* independent standard normal random variables [5]. The value  produced by the chi-square test is called the chi-square statistic. A small value means that there is a high correlation between the expected and observed data, i.e. there is no difference between them. The eqution for calculating the chi-square statistic is shown below.\n",
